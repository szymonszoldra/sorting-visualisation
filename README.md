# Sorting Visualisation

UPDATE July 2021

The application was rewritten to TypeScript and refactored a bit.

This is not the most idiomatic way of writing React, but React was used simply as a tool for displaying algorithms, so I allowed myself to bend some rules (mainly with the way I change the state of the application by modifying the array not only with a setter). My assumption is that if you know the rules, you can break them for your own purposes. :)

I wrote the app on my own, any similarities are coincidental.
